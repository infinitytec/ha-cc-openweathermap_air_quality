# Forked from ha-cc-openweathermap_all by [viktak](https://github.com/viktak/ha-cc-openweathermap_all)
Home Assistant custom component combining multiple OpenWeatherMap API calls for air quality.

This fork is to try to maintain functionality of the integration. The API requires a credit card number.

## Installation

### Automatic
Use HACS to install it.

### Manual
Copy the files to their proper location

## Usage

`configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
sensor:
    - platform: openweathermap_air_quality
      api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
      latitude: YOUR_LATITUDE
      longitude: YOUR_LONGITUDE
```

### Explanation
`YOUR_API_KEY`: API key to use with the service. You can obtain yours at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).<br>
`YOUR_LATITUDE`, `YOUR_LONGITUDE`: coordinates of the desired location.

## Sensors created
Currently, the following sensors are created by this integration:
- sensor.owm_pollution_ammonia_nh3
- sensor.owm_pollution_carbon_monoxide_co
- sensor.owm_pollution_coarse_particles_pm10
- sensor.owm_pollution_fine_particles_pm2_5
- sensor.owm_pollution_nitrogen_dioxide_no2
- sensor.owm_pollution_nitrogen_monoxide_no
- sensor.owm_pollution_overall_air_quality
- sensor.owm_pollution_ozone_o3
- sensor.owm_pollution_sulphur_dioxide_so2
- sensor.owm_ultraviolet_index
- sensor.owm_pollution_forecast

More are coming in the future as the API, my free time and my skills allow. :)
